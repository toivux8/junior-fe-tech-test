## Overview

Hi! Welcome to the Skedulo frontend tech project. You will find the details for your test [here](./src/INSTRUCTIONS.md). Once you're ready reach out to your hiring manager and they will share some github names to add as collaborators who will review your submission.

Once you have completed the exercise it would be great to see a readme that contains some of your thinking while working through the test, constraints you worked within, some decisions and compromises you needed to make, and anything else you think would be interesting for the reviewers to know.

Good luck! And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact your hiring manager.

## My thoughts
This is a great test for me to review and learn more about frontend knownledge. I understand more about Typescript by using different types and interface. I also learn more about Asynchronous function by using Async/await function. I noticed that in the file "db.json" does not have the field "contactName", it just has the "contactId", so I think the results are displayed will have the ID of Contact assigned to the job. I would love to hear some feedback from you. Thank you so much!
